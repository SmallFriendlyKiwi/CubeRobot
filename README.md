# CubeRobot
This is a project that utilises the Polulu Mini Maestro 12-Channel USB Servo Controller to control the servos on an Otvinta 3D printed cube robot.

Otvinta do sell software for the cube robot but I thought it would be interesting to explore some of my own code in Python since I was teaching it at the time and saw it as a good way to become more familiar
with what I was teaching the children.

The code allows input of cube notation used to perform a scramble.  At the end of the scramble it reverses the the scramble to give the illusion of the robot solving the cube.

Further work would utilise the camera to read the colours on each face of the cube and, from there, solve the cube autonomously
