# CubeRobot
This is a project that utilises the Polulu Mini Maestro 12-Channel USB Servo Controller to control the servos on an Otvinta 3D printed cube robot.

Otvinta do sell software for the cube robot but I thought it would be interesting to explore some of my own code in Python since I was teaching it at the time and saw it as a good way to become more familiar with what I was teaching the children.

The code allows input of a cube definition string.  The software finds a solution which the robot follows to solve the cube.

Further work would utilise the camera to read the colours on each face of the cube and, from there, solve the cube autonomously
